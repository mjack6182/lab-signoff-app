    steps:
      # 1️⃣ Checkout the repository
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # 2️⃣ Set up Java 17
      - name: Set up Java
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          java-version: '17'
          distribution: 'temurin'

      # 3️⃣ Build the backend (skip tests here)
      - name: Build backend
        working-directory: ./backend
        run: ./gradlew build -x test
        # -x test means "skip tests" so we don’t run them twice.
        # This ensures tests only run in the dedicated step below.

      # 4️⃣ Run backend tests using the test-only MongoDB config
      - name: Run backend tests
        working-directory: ./backend
        run: ./gradlew test -Dspring.config.location=classpath:/application-test.properties # The -Dspring.config.location flag forces Spring Boot to use application-test.yml
        # which contains dummy MongoDB credentials. This ensures tests pass in CI without
        # needing real MongoDB credentials or Docker.
